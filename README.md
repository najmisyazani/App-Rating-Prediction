The project aimed to predict app ratings using a Google Play Store dataset. Key steps included:

  Data Cleaning: Handled missing values and converted data types.

  Data Transformation: Applied log transformation to skewed features and one-hot encoding to categorical variables.

  Exploratory Analysis: Conducted univariate and bivariate analyses using visualizations like boxplots and histograms.

  Model Training: Used a linear regression model, achieving R2 scores of 0.16 on the training set and 0.11 on the test set, indicating a weak fit.
